Adds userfriendly multilingual content management support into Wordpress.

== Description ==

Writing multilingual content is already hard enough, why make the plugin even more complicated? I created qTranslate to let Wordpress have an easy to use interface for managing a multilingual web site.

qTranslate makes creation of multilingual content as easy as working with a single language.

- One-Click-Switching between the languages - Change the language as easy as switching between Visual and HTML
- No need for adding special characters or strings to seperate your multilingual texts! - qTranslate will handle them almost everywhere for you
- Multilingual dates out of the box - Translates dates and time for you.
- Comes with a lot of languages already builtin! - English, German, Simplified Chinese and a lot of others
- No more juggling with .mo-files! - qTranslate will download them automatically for you
- Choose one of 3 Modes to make your URLs pretty and SEO-friendly. - The everywhere compatible `?lang=en`, simple and beautiful `/en/foo/` or nice and neat `en.yoursite.com`
- One language for each URL - Users and SEO will thank you for not mixing multilingual content.

qTranslate supports infinite languages, which can be easily added/modified/deleted via the comfortable Configuration Page.
All you need to do is activate the plugin and start writing the content!
