Adds userfriendly multilingual content support into Wordpress.

== Description ==

Writing multilingual content is already hard enough, why make the plugin even more complicated?

qTranslate makes creation of multilingual content as easy as working with a single language.

- No need to edit the plugin file to get your language working! - Use the comfortable Configuration Page
- No more adding language tags into your text! - Let qTranslate manage them for you
- No more problems with `<!--more-->` tags in multilingual content! - qTranslate will make them work the way you want it
- Add your own language in seconds! - Thanks to the comfortable Configuration Page
- Comes with 3 languages already builtin! - English, German and Simplified Chinese

qTranslate supports infinite languages, which can be easily added/modified/deleted via the comfortable Configuration Page.
All you need to do is activate the plugin and start writing the content! Well, almost, you will need to get the .mo languages
files for the languages you want to use, just like changing Wordpress' language. But there is an easy [tutorial in the 
official documentation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language#Manually_Installing_Language_Files)
on how to do to this.
